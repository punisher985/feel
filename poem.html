           You are like , a bubble to me.<br />Bubble of joy indeed.<br />
           I know I am being selfish,<br />but I like that sparkling bubble much,<br />
           rather than that dull one.<br />
           I hate those things,<br />things that make you upset.<br />
           Cuz they pave the way,<br />for my sadness too.<br /><br /><br />
           You are so real, you are so fun;<br />That you remind me of, the setting sun.<br />
           Yes the setting sun.<br />
           Your arms provide me the same calmness,<br />as if I was at sea shore with you;<br />
           Watching the sun uniting with sea,<br />the same way that our souls have done,<br /> few years ago.<br />
           Your breath provides me with same warmness,<br />as that sunset provides.<br />
           and I just don't want the moment to end,<br />even for my entire life.<br /><br /><br />
           I see your eyes, so soothing,<br />as if the sea is at its best behaviour;<br />
           I see depth in those eyes,ofcourse not lies,<br />but utter respect for me,<br />
           those beautiful eyes,<br />really mesmerize me,<br />So pretty as can be;<br />
           I fell for them way too easily.<br /><br /><br />
           When I gaze deeply into you, I try,<br />I try hard, not to cry.<br />
           Your heart so pure for that I would die;<br />
           I hear your heartbeats, and mine too,<br />as if they are trying to put a jingle together.<br />
           Jingle that I want to hear from dusk to dawn,<br />repeating itself on and on.<br /><br />
           I tell myself not to look,when you walk on by;<br />
           But I take a peek,And so stupidly I smile.<br /><br /><br />
           Taking things slow would be best,<br />as I don't want things to be a mess,<br />
           I to live every moment as long as I could,<br />
           and keep it with one of our souvenisr,<br />that we have created with our love so true.<br /><br /><br />
           Sitting on that sand,<br />with sea kissing our feets.<br />
           Being in our own Dreamland;<br />Playing with each others hands and hair,<br />
               Too shy to kiss,<br />I bet we are a wonderful pair.</strong>
